##  Tasks Overview

###  Task 1 – Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

* **Dataset:** [world bank group Dataset](https://github.com/Prodigy-InfoTech/data-science-datasets/tree/main/Task%201)(`world bank group.cvs`)
* **Objective:** Perform exploratory data analysis on a dataset to identify trends, distributions, and correlations.
* **Key Steps:**

  * Data cleaning & preprocessing
  * Statistical summaries
  * Data visualization using Matplotlib & Seaborn
* **Outcome:** Extracted insights and created meaningful visualizations to understand the dataset.

###  Task 2 – Machine Learning Model

* **Dataset:** [Titanic Dataset](https://github.com/Prodigy-InfoTech/data-science-datasets/tree/main/Task%202) (`Titanic.cvs`)
* **Objective:** Implement a machine learning algorithm (e.g., regression/classification) to solve a predictive problem.
* **Key Steps:**

  * Preprocessed dataset (encoding, scaling, splitting)
  * Applied ML algorithms
  * Evaluated performance with accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
* **Outcome:** Achieved a trained ML model with good predictive performance.

###  Task 3 – Decision Tree Classifier

* **Dataset:** [Bank Marketing Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/bank+marketing) (`Bank Marketing .cvs`)
* **Objective:** Predict whether a client subscribes to a term deposit.
* **Key Steps:**

  * Handled categorical features
  * Split data into train & test sets
  * Trained Decision Tree Classifier using scikit-learn
  * Evaluated using confusion matrix & classification report
  * Visualized the decision tree
* **Outcome:** Built an interpretable model to predict customer subscription with decision rules.

---

###  Task 4 – Sentiment Analysis

* **Dataset:** [Twitter Sentiment Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets) (`twitter_training.csv`)
* **Objective:** Classify tweets into *positive, negative, neutral*.
* **Key Steps:**

  * Text preprocessing (cleaning, tokenization, stopword removal, lemmatization)
  * Feature extraction (TF-IDF / CountVectorizer)
  * Model training with ML algorithms (Logistic Regression / Naive Bayes / SVM)
  * Evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
* **Outcome:** Built a text classifier capable of analyzing sentiment from social media posts.

---

###  Task 5 – US Accidents Data Analysis

* **Dataset:** [US Accidents Dataset (Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sobhanmoosavi/us-accidents)
* **Objective:** Perform **EDA on traffic accident data (2016–2021)** to understand accident severity, locations, and patterns.
* **Key Steps:**

  * Analyzed accident distribution by state, city, and time of day
  * Identified accident severity patterns
  * Studied weather & road conditions affecting accidents
  * Created visualizations (heatmaps, bar charts, geographical maps)
* **Outcome:** Extracted accident-prone areas, high-risk time periods, and environmental factors influencing accidents.
