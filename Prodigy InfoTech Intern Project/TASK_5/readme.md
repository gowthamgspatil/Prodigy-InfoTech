#  Task 4 - US Accidents Data Analysis

**Prodigy InfoTech Data Science Internship**

##  Project Overview

This project is part of my **Data Science Internship at Prodigy InfoTech**.
The objective is to analyze the **US Accidents Dataset** from Kaggle and extract meaningful insights related to traffic accidents in the United States.

The dataset contains accident records from **2016–2021**, with features such as location, weather, time, severity, and other contributing factors.

##  Repository Structure

```
│── us-accident.ipynb     # Jupyter Notebook with analysis & visualizations  
│── README.md             # Project documentation  
```

##  Requirements

Make sure the following libraries are installed before running the notebook:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn plotly
```

---

##  Steps in the Notebook

1. **Import Libraries** → Load required Python packages
2. **Load Dataset** → Read the US Accidents dataset from Kaggle
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

   * Check missing values and data distribution
   * Analyze accident trends over time
   * State-wise and city-wise accident frequency
   * Severity level distribution
   * Weather and road condition analysis
4. **Data Visualization**

   * Bar plots, heatmaps, and line charts using **Matplotlib & Seaborn**
   * Interactive geographical maps with **Plotly**
5. **Insights & Observations**

   * Identify accident-prone states and cities
   * Find weather conditions contributing to accidents
   * Study time-of-day and seasonal patterns

---

##  Key Insights

* Accidents are highly concentrated in **urban areas**.
* **California, Florida, and Texas** have the highest number of accidents.
* Most accidents occur during **peak traffic hours** (morning & evening).
* Bad weather conditions (fog, rain, snow) increase accident probability.
* Accident severity varies significantly by state and road conditions.

##  How to Run

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/prodigy-task4-us-accidents.git
   cd prodigy-task4-us-accidents
   ```
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook us-accident.ipynb
   ```
3. Run all cells sequentially to reproduce the analysis.
